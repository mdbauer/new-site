# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract: "This paper discusses the measurement, assessment, and communication of risks and uncertainty that are relevant for monetary policy. It provides a taxonomy of policy-relevant uncertainty related to the state and the structure of the economy, and the formation of expectations. A wide range of tools is available to assess and quantify uncertainty and the balance of risks. Qualitative assessments of uncertainty---in policy statements, minutes, and speeches---are the main tools to communicate uncertainty and the balance of risks across major central banks. However, the use of quantitative tools for such communications---including scenario analysis---is evolving, and so far no clear consensus has emerged for best practices."
