# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract: "We document that the Fed's perceived monetary policy response to inflation shifted materially
    over the post-pandemic period. In forward-looking policy rules estimated from surveys of macroeconomic
    forecasters, the inflation coefficient rose significantly after liftoff from the zero lower bound in March
    2022. Consistent with a shift in the perceived policy response, event studies show that interest rates
    became significantly more sensitive to inflation data surprises following liftoff. The increase in the
    perceived inflation response likely aided the transmission of monetary policy to the real economy and
    improved the Fed's inflation-unemployment tradeoff. The timing of this shift and additional evidence from
    surveys and financial markets suggest that forecasters and markets were highly uncertain about the
    monetary policy rule prior to liftoff and learned about it from the Fed's rate hikes."
