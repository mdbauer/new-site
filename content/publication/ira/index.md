# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract: "The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) represents the largest climate policy
      action ever undertaken in the United States. Its legislative path was marked by two abrupt shifts as the
      likelihood of climate policy action fell to near zero and then rose to near certainty.  We investigate
      equity price reactions to these two events, which represent major realizations of climate policy
      transition risk. Our results highlight the heterogeneous nature of climate policy risk exposure. We find
      sizable reactions that differ by industry as well as across firm-level measures of greenness such as
      environmental scores and emission intensities. While the financial market response to the IRA was
      economically significant, it did not lead to instability or financial stress, suggesting that transition
      risks posed by climate policies as ambitious as the IRA may be manageable."
