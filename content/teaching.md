### Empirical Asset Pricing, Ph.D. Course, UC Berkeley, Haas School of Business

Together with [Martin Lettau](https://sites.google.com/view/martinlettau/home) I am teaching the 2nd year
Ph.D. course "Empirical Asset Pricing" at the [Haas School of
Business](https://haas.berkeley.edu/). Martin teaches the first half of the course, focusing on equity
markets, predictability of stock returns, and cross-sectional asset pricing. I teach the second half of the
course, focusing on bond markets, the term structure of interest rates, and macro-finance linkages. This year,
in 2025, is the second time we're teaching this course together.
