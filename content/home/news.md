#### SF Fed Center for Monetary Research

The [Center for Monetary Research](https://www.frbsf.org/about-us/economic-research/center-for-monetary-research/) (CMR) is a new initiative, launched in October 2024 by the San Francisco Fed, that aims to improve our understanding of the links between monetary policy, financial markets, and the macroeconomy. Among the [CMR data pages](https://www.frbsf.org/about-us/economic-research/center-for-monetary-research/data/) are three that make available updated estimates for some of my papers:
- [Treasury Yield Skewness](https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/data-and-indicators/treasury-yield-skewness/) (based on [2024 JF paper](/publication/skewness/) with Chernov)
- [Monetary Policy Surprises](https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/data-and-indicators/monetary-policy-surprises/) (based on [2023 NBERMA paper](/publication/skewness/) with Swanson)
- [Monetary Policy Uncertainty](https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/data-and-indicators/market-based-monetary-policy-uncertainty/) (based on [2022 EJ paper](/publication/monetary-policy-uncertainty) with Lakdawala \& Mueller)
