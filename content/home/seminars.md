#### Virtual Seminar on Monetary Economics

The [Virtual Seminar on Monetary Economics](https://cepr.org/events/event-series/virtual-seminar-monetary-economics-vsme) is a monthly online research seminar, jointly hosted by our [Center for Monetary Research](https://www.frbsf.org/about-us/economic-research/center-for-monetary-research/) and CEPR. Its focus is the study of monetary policy, covering topics such as central banks’ goals and frameworks, design of optimal policies, implementation choices, transmission to financial markets and the macroeconomy, and international dimensions of monetary policy. My coorganizers are [Refet Gürkaynak](http://refet.bilkent.edu.tr/), [Klodiana Istrefi](https://sites.google.com/site/istrefiklodiana/), and [Michael McMahon](https://mcmahonecon.com/).
