Welcome to my website! I am a research economist focusing on monetary economics, macro-finance and climate finance.

- Senior Research Advisor at the [Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco](https://www.frbsf.org/)
- Lecturer at [UC Berkeley, Haas School of Business](https://haas.berkeley.edu/)
- Associate Editor at the [Journal of Financial Econometrics](https://academic.oup.com/jfec), the [Journal of Business & Economic Statistics](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/ubes20), and the [Journal of Money, Credit and Banking](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15384616)
- Research Fellow at [CEPR](https://cepr.org/), [CESifo](https://www.cesifo.org/en), and the
[IMFS](https://www.imfs-frankfurt.de/en.html)
- Steering Committee for the SF Fed's new [Center for Monetary Research](https://www.frbsf.org/about-us/economic-research/center-for-monetary-research/)

My research mainly studies the role of financial markets for the macroeconomy, monetary policy, and the green
transition. I am particularly interested in understanding the effects of monetary policy on the yield curve
and asset prices---including monetary policy surprises, forward guidance, monetary policy communication,
quantitative easing, monetary policy uncertainty, and risks to the economic outlook. More recently I've been
studying issues in climate economics and climate finance, including the pricing of climate risks.
