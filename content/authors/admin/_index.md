Welcome to my website! I am a research economist at the [Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco](https://www.frbsf.org/) studying monetary policy, macroeconomics and financial markets. In addition, I am a research fellow at [CEPR](https://cepr.org/), [CESifo](https://www.cesifo.org/en), and the
[IMFS](https://www.imfs-frankfurt.de/en.html). I am currently on leave from the [University of Hamburg](https://www.uni-hamburg.de/).

My research focuses on the role of financial markets for the macroeconomy,
monetary policy, and climate change. I am
particularly interested in understanding the effects of monetary policy on
the yield curve and asset prices---including monetary policy surprises, forward guidance,
monetary policy communication, quantitative easing, monetary policy uncertainty,
and risks to the economic outlook. More recently I've
been working on social discount rates, the social cost of carbon and climate
finance.
