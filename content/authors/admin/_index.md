Welcome to my website! I am a Professor of Economics at [Universität
Hamburg](https://www.uni-hamburg.de/), and a research fellow at [CEPR](https://cepr.org/), [CESifo](https://www.cesifo.org/en), and the
[IMFS](https://www.imfs-frankfurt.de/en.html). I am currently on leave from the [Federal Reserve Bank
of San Francisco](https://frbsf.org/).

My research focuses on the role of financial markets for the macroeconomy,
monetary policy, and climate change. I am
particularly interested in understanding the effects of monetary policy on
the yield curve and asset prices---including monetary policy surprises, forward guidance,
monetary policy communication, quantitative easing, monetary policy uncertainty,
and risks to the economic outlook. More recently I've
been working on social discount rates, the social cost of carbon and climate
finance.
